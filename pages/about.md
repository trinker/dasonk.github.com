## About Me

I am a graduate student studying Statistics at Iowa State University. I love R and Linux. I have been happily married since April of 2011. I have a beagle named Brutus and I'm sure he loves you.

I enjoy programming in R.  You can browse some of the projects I've been working on at [my github page](http://www.github.com/Dasonk).  I am also active at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1003565/dason) and mostly answer question to do with the [r] tag.
